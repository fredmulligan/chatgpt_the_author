End of the Wild
ACT 1 SCENE 1

  

FADE IN:

INT. ABE'S CABIN - DAY

We open to see ABE, a grizzled old hunter, sitting alone in his dimly lit cabin. The walls are adorned with trophies from past hunts – a testament to his legendary status. He stares wistfully at a faded photograph of him and his hunting group, a group long gone.

JOHN, his protégé, enters the room. There's a brief moment of silence before they exchange a nod of acknowledgement.

ABE
What brings you here, John?

JOHN
I wanted to talk to you about the upcoming hunt.

ABE
(sighs) I figured as much.

John pulls out a map and lays it on the table.

JOHN
I've been doing some research, and I think I've found a herd of buffalo that's bigger than anything you've ever seen.

ABE
(smiles) You always did have a talent for finding the best game.

JOHN
(excitedly) I think we can take down the biggest and strongest buffalo in the herd. We'll be legends.

ABE
(grimly) Legends, huh? Is that what we're after?

John looks at Abe, sensing a shift in his tone.

ABE (CONT'D)
(sighs) You know, John, I've been at this game for a long time. I've seen and done more than most people ever will. But as I sit here, looking at that old picture, I can't help but wonder if it was all worth it.

John is taken aback. He's never heard Abe express doubts before.

JOHN
What do you mean?

ABE 
(shaking his head) We've killed so many of these creatures, John. We've hunted them to near extinction. And for what? So we can say we were the best damn hunters that ever lived?

John looks down, unsure of what to say.

ABE (CONT'D)
(pauses) But maybe it's not too late to make amends. Maybe we can go out there and find a way to coexist with these creatures. To live with them, instead of just killing them.

John looks up, seeing a glimmer of hope in Abe's eyes.

JOHN
(calmly) I'm with you, Abe. Whatever you think is best.

ABE 
(smiling) Alright then, let's gear up and hit the trail. We've got some big game to hunt.

FADE OUT.
ACT 1 SCENE 2
  

FADE IN:

INT. ABE'S CABIN - DAY

ABE is polishing his hunting rifle when JOHN enters the room.

JOHN:
(slightly nervous) Hey, Abe.

ABE:
(looks up) Johnny boy! You seem jittery. What's on your mind?

JOHN:
(exhales) I just wanted to check in with you about the plan.

ABE puts down his rifle and leans back in his chair.

ABE:
(smiling) Ah, the plan. I've been thinking about it a lot lately.

JOHN:
(curious) And?

ABE:
(defiantly) We're going to find the biggest goddamn herd of buffalo out there and take them down.

JOHN:
(nervously) And if it doesn't go as planned?

ABE:
(leans forward) Then we adjust. We're hunters, John, we adapt to the situation. Don't worry about it.

JOHN:
(still nervous) But what if -

ABE interrupts him.

ABE:
(angrily) What's with all the goddamn questions, John? You're supposed to be my protégé, not a whiny little baby!

JOHN looks hurt.

ABE (CONT'D):
(calmer) Look, I didn't bring you along because you're soft. You're one of the best hunters I've ever seen, and I believe in you. So, I need you to dig deep, stop doubting, and focus on the hunt.

JOHN takes a deep breath and nods.

JOHN:
(resolute) You're right, Abe. I'm ready.

ABE:
(smiling) Damn right, you are.

FADE OUT.
ACT 1 SCENE 3
  

FADE IN:

EXT. HUNTING LODGE - DAY

Abe and John pull up to a group of hunters standing outside a rustic hunting lodge, rifles slung over their shoulders. The hunters turn to face them, sizing up the newcomers.

ABE:
(to John) Let me do the talking.

They approach the group, and Abe clears his throat.

ABE:
(laconically) Looking for some skilled hunters.

The group looks at each other, sizing up Abe and John.

BEN:
(smiling) What kind of hunt?

ABE:
(firmly) Buffalo.

The group murmur among themselves, hesitant to commit.

SARAH:
(steps forward) I'm in.

Abe and John turn to look at Sarah, surprised.

ABE:
(raising his eyebrows) Really?

SARAH:
(nodding) I can handle a buffalo hunt.

ABE:
(skeptical) It's a tough game. You sure you're up for it?

SARAH:
(defiantly) I've been hunting since I was a kid. I can handle it.

ABE nods, impressed.

ABE:
(turns to the rest of the group) Who else?

WILLIAM:
(steps forward) I'll come.

Abe and John look at each other, noticing William's hesitation.

JOHN:
(skeptical) You sound unsure.

WILLIAM:
(avoiding eye contact) It's just...I've done a lot of hunting in my life. Killed more animals than I can count. I'm not sure I want to keep doing this.

ABE:
(scoffing) What else are you gonna do, William? This is what we do.

WILLIAM shrugs.

ABE:
(pushes) You're either with us or against us.

William looks conflicted for a moment but ultimately nods.

WILLIAM:
(quietly) I'm in.

ABE:
(smiles) Good. Thanks for joining us.

The hunters nod, and Abe and John walk away.

JOHN:
(worried) Are we really gonna bring him?

ABE:
(laconically) He'll be fine.

CUT TO:

EXT. ANOTHER HUNTING LODGE - DAY

Abe and John pull up to another group of hunters outside a different hunting lodge.

ABE:
(to John) Remember, let me do the talking.

They approach the group, and Abe clears his throat.

ABE:
(laconically) Looking for some skilled hunters.

The group turns to face them.

ABE (CONT'D):
(firmly) Buffalo.

The hunters murmur among themselves, sizing up Abe and John.

COLONEL WHITE:
(steps forward) You're too late. We've already got our own hunting party.

ABE:
(smiling) Too bad. You're missing out.

COLONEL WHITE:
(raising his eyebrows) Is that so?

ABE:
(leans forward) We've got a plan to bring down the biggest buffalo herd in these parts.

The hunters look at each other, impressed.

COLONEL WHITE:
(menacingly) You sure you're up for it?

ABE:
(smiling) We're more than up for it.

JOHN:
(quietly to Abe) Do we need to worry about these guys?

ABE:
(whispering back) Just keep your guard up.

COLONEL WHITE:
(to his group) Let's go, boys. We've got work to do.

The hunters turn and enter the lodge. Abe and John watch them go, hesitant.

ABE:
(to John) We'll need to keep an eye on them.

JOHN:
(nodding) Agreed.

Abe and John turn and walk away.

FADE OUT.
ACT 1 SCENE 4
  

FADE IN:

EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

The hunters are gathered around a flickering campfire. Abe sits on a log, staring off into the darkness. John is kneeling beside him, poking at the fire.

SARAH:
(raising her hand) Can I say something?

ABE:
(nodding) Go ahead.

SARAH:
(softly) I joined this hunt because I want to prove to myself that I can do it. That I can take down one of the biggest beasts known to man.

BEN:
(laughing) And here I thought you joined for the company.

SARAH:
(giving Ben a playful punch) Shut up.

Everyone chuckles, and the conversation turns to James, the silent hunter in their midst.

WILLIAM:
(leaning forward) So, James. Why did you join the hunt?

James remains silent, staring into the flames.

JOHN:
(elbowing James) Come on, man. Don't keep us in suspense.

ABE:
(smirking) He's probably just here for the ride.

JAMES:
(quietly) None of your damn business.

The hunters fall silent, and Abe stares at James, who seems to be lost in his own thoughts.

ABE:
(softly) Sorry, James. We didn't mean to pry.

A long moment of silence passes, broken only by the crackling of the fire.

BEN:
(clapping his hands) Alright, enough of this serious talk. Anyone got a good joke?

The hunters all laugh, and the mood lightens. They spend the rest of the night swapping stories and sharing laughs, each one bonding over their collective love of the hunt.

CUT TO:

EXT. CAMPFIRE - LATER

The hunters are asleep around the campfire, their bodies outlined by the soft glow of the flames. In the distance, the howl of a wolf echoes through the night.

FADE OUT.
ACT 1 SCENE 5
  

FADE IN:

EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY

Abe and his group of hunters, including John, Sarah, Ben, and William, are riding on horseback through the rugged terrain of the American wilderness. Ruth, a native guide, leads the way, expertly navigating through the rocky terrain.

ABE:
(to Ruth) How much further, Ruth?

RUTH:
(pointing ahead) Not far now. We'll make camp by nightfall.

JOHN:
(looking around) This is some rough country.

SARAH:
(nodding) Yeah, I can see why not many come out here.

BEN:
(smiling) That's why it's perfect for us.

WILLIAM:
(glancing at Ruth) You sure you know where you're going, Ruth?

RUTH:
(turning to him) I've lived here my whole life. I know every inch of this land.

The group rides in silence for a while, the only sound the heavy breathing of their horses and the crunching of gravel under their hooves.

ABE:
(sighing) It's been a long time since I've been out here.

JOHN:
(smiling) You haven't lost your touch, Abe.

ABE:
(looking around) This land... it's as wild and unforgiving as ever. I almost forgot how it feels.

BEN:
(smiling) That's why we're here, Abe. To get a taste of that wildness.

Suddenly, they hear the sound of a large animal moving in the distance.

WILLIAM:
(raising his rifle) What the hell is that?

RUTH:
(relaxing) Just a grizzly. Stay calm.

ABE:
(smiling wistfully) Ah, just like old times.

The group continues riding, slowly becoming more comfortable with the rough terrain around them.

JOHN:
(squinting ahead) Ruth, what's up ahead? Looks like a big drop off.

RUTH:
(nodding) A ravine. We'll have to cross it to get to the other side.

SARAH:
(beaming) My favorite part.

They dismount and begin to lead their horses down the steep incline, carefully maneuvering through the tangled brush and loose rocks.

As they reach the bottom of the ravine, they can hear the sound of rushing water up ahead.

BEN:
(smiling) Looks like we've got a river to cross.

The group approaches the water's edge, the river looks treacherous and deep.

WILLIAM:
(shaking his head) This doesn't look good.

SARAH:
(grinning) Leave it to me.

Sarah expertly ties a rope between two trees, creating a makeshift pulley system to help them cross the river safely.

ABE:
(nodding approvingly) Good thinking, Sarah.

The group begins to cross, carefully hooking themselves onto the rope and shimmying over the water.

As they reach the other side, John turns back to look at the ravine, the wildness of the land striking him with a new sense of revelation.

JOHN:
(whispering to himself) This is what it's all about.

FADE OUT.
ACT 1 SCENE 6
  FADE IN:

EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

Abe and the group of hunters reach the bank of a rushing river, water frothing and dangerous-looking.

WILLIAM:
(grimacing) Looks like we got our first obstacle, boys.

SARAH:
(smiling) Don't worry, I got this.

Sarah pulls out a coil of rope from her pack and expertly ties it around a large tree. She tosses the other end towards the opposite bank where it catches on a root.

SARAH:
(motions towards the river) One at a time. Hook yourself up and shimmy slowly.

The hunters exchange a glance and nod, trusting Sarah's expertise. They move to the rope, attaching themselves to it and slowly crossing the river. John watches as Ben goes first.

BEN:
(grinning) This isn't so bad.

William follows, grunting as he struggles against the current.

WILLIAM:
(panting) Remind me not to do this again.

John stands at the edge of the riverbank, staring at the water frantically trying to come up with a plan.

JOHN:
(whispering to himself) I don't know if I can do this.

Sarah notices, and comes to his side.

SARAH:
(smiling) You got this, John.

John nods, attaching himself to the rope and slowly making his way across, struggling against the current.

JOHN:
(grunting) This is insane!

SARAH:
(laughing) You got this, John! Just keep going!

Finally, John reaches the opposite bank, collapsing in a heap, panting and gasping.

ABE:
(nodding) Good work, Sarah.

SARAH:
(smiling) I told you I got this.

The hunters collect their supplies and continue on. John turns back towards the river, awed by the power of nature.

JOHN:
(whispers) It is a beautiful, wild land.

FADE OUT.
ACT 1 SCENE 7
  

7. NATIVE ENCOUNTER

The hunters trudge through dense forest, sweat pouring down their faces, rifles at the ready. Suddenly, they spot a group of natives in the distance. The group halts, and Abe signals for them to stay put. John steps forward, holding up his hands in a gesture of peace.

JOHN:
(nervously) Hold on, guys. We don't need any trouble.

The group of natives grows closer, led by a tall, imposing man named Red Hawk. He regards the hunters with a steely gaze.

RED HAWK:
(coldly) Who are you, and what are you doing on our land?

JOHN:
(trying to placate him) We mean no harm. We're just hunting buffalo.

RED HAWK:
(skeptically) Hunting, eh? And what will you do with all that meat?

The hunters exchange a look. They had never really considered the question.

BEN:
(defensively) We'll sell it, of course. Buffalo meat is worth a lot of money.

RED HAWK:
(mocking) Money. Always money. You white men and your obsession with wealth.

A wave of murmurs ripple through the group, and John steps forward.

JOHN:
(earnestly) Look, we're not here to cause any trouble. We just want to hunt and provide for our families.

RED HAWK:
(bitterly) And what about our families? Don't we have a right to live off this land too?

Abe steps forward, holding his hands up in a gesture of peace.

ABE:
(respectfully) Look, we understand your concerns. But we're not here to take anything away from you. We just want to hunt, and then we'll be on our way.

RED HAWK:
(darkly) Your way, eh? Some of you white men have a way of never leaving once you've settled somewhere.

A tense silence falls over the group. Suddenly, a young warrior steps forward, brandishing a tomahawk.

WARRIOR:
(threateningly) We should kill them now, before they cause any more trouble.

Another warrior steps forward, shaking his head.

SECOND WARRIOR:
(calmingly) No, let's hear them out. Maybe there's a way we can settle this peacefully.

After a long, tense standoff, Red Hawk finally relents.

RED HAWK:
(coldly) Very well. But remember this: we are watching you, and if you cause any more trouble, we won't hesitate to use force.

The hunters nod, relieved, and they turn to leave when John steps forward once again.

JOHN:
(offering his hand) Thank you, Chief Red Hawk. We appreciate your understanding.

Red Hawk regards his hand warily, then shakes it firmly.

RED HAWK:
(nodding) You're welcome. Safe hunting.

The hunters nod gratefully, then turn to leave. John is the last in line, exchanging a long look with Red Hawk before following the others.
ACT 1 SCENE 8
  

SCENE 8: NIGHTTIME AMBUSH

The hunters set up camp for the night, tired and weary after a long day's journey. Ruth keeps watch, taking turns with John, while the others rest. 

Suddenly, a low growl breaks the silence. The group snaps to attention, rifles at the ready. In the distance, they can see a pack of wolves gathering around their campsite. 

Abe motions for them to stay put, and they keep their eyes fixed on the approaching animals. But before they can react, the wolves pounce, attacking with ferocity.

The hunters are caught off guard, scrambling to fend off the wild animals. Ruth is the first to act, grabbing a torch and waving it at the wolves to keep them at bay. John fires his rifle, taking down one wolf after another. The others battle it out with their knives and machetes, trying to protect their supplies and equipment.

The chaos lasts for what seems like an eternity, but soon the wolves back off, defeated. The hunters are panting and bleeding, but they've managed to fend off the attack. 

Ben takes a deep breath, putting away his knife.

BEN:
(panting) Shit, I've never seen wolves attack like that before. 

Sarah checks on the wounded members of the group, trying to assess their injuries.

SARAH: 
(worriedly) Is everyone okay? 

William looks around, his face stoic.

WILLIAM:
(grimly) We're alive, that's what matters. But our supplies... 

He trails off, looking at the scattered pile of equipment and provisions. They've lost most of their provisions, and their equipment is damaged beyond repair.

John surveys the damage, his face grim.

JOHN:
(quietly) We're in trouble. We can't continue without supplies. 

Abe looks around, his eyes darting from one hunter to another. He knows they're in a tough spot.

ABE:
(calmingly) Alright, let's not panic. We'll have to make do with what we have. We still have our rifles and our knives. And we'll hunt for our food from now on.

The group nods in agreement, their eyes determined.

Sarah looks at the others, a fierce resolve in her eyes.

SARAH:
(determined) We'll make it through this. We're hunters, dammit. We don't let a little setback like this stop us.

The hunters band together, picking up their supplies and setting out to continue their journey, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
ACT 1 SCENE 9
  

SCENE 9: ARRIVAL AT FORT WHITE

The hunters arrive at Fort White, a dusty little town that looks like it's seen better days. There are a few dilapidated buildings, a saloon, and a general store. 

As they approach the town's center, they see a group of men standing around, their rifles slung over their shoulders. One of them steps forward, a scowl on his face.

This is Col. White, the leader of a rival hunting party.

COL. WHITE:
(aggressively) Well, well, well. If it isn't Abe and his merry band of misfits. 

Abe and the others tense up, wary of the Colonel's hostility.

ABE:
(defensively) What do you want, White? We're just here to resupply and move on. 

COL. WHITE:
(smirking) Is that all you're here for? Or are you hoping to beat us to the buffalo herd? I hear they've been sighted not too far from here.

John steps forward, his hand on his rifle.

JOHN:
(threateningly) We're not interested in competing with you, White. We're just here to hunt.

COL. WHITE:
(laughing) Suit yourself, boy. But don't come crying to me when we've bagged more buffalo than you have.

The hunters exchange tense looks, knowing that they'll have to be vigilant in the days ahead. 

As they make their way towards the general store, they can hear Colonel White and his group laughing and jeering behind them. Abe turns to John, his voice low.

ABE:
(calmingly) Don't let them get to you, John. We'll show them what we're made of in the end.

John nods, his eyes narrowed with determination. 

The group enters the general store, which is run by a grizzled old man with a thick beard. He looks them up and down, his expression skeptical.

STOREKEEPER:
(suspiciously) What can I do for you, boys?

Abe steps forward, his voice steady.

ABE:
(gruffly) We're in need of supplies. Bullets, knives, gunpowder, and anything else you have.

The storekeeper nods, reaching for a crate behind him.

STOREKEEPER:
(grudgingly) I've got what you need. But I'm warning you, the prices have gone up since the last time you were here.

Abe nods, looking around the store.

ABE:
(seriously) We'll take what we need, and we'll pay what it's worth. No more, no less.

The storekeeper nods, impressed by Abe's no-nonsense attitude.

STOREKEEPER:
(nodding) Alright then. You boys go ahead and stock up. And watch your backs out there. This town's got more than its share of troublemakers.

The hunters nod, grateful for the warning, and begin to sift through the supplies. As they load up, they can hear the sounds of Colonel White and his group entertaining themselves outside, their laughter echoing through the thin walls of the store.

Sarah turns to the others, her eyes blazing with anger.

SARAH:
(angrily) I can't stand those assholes. Always trying to one-up us.

William shakes his head, his eyes sad.

WILLIAM:
(sadly) It's the nature of the business, Sarah. We're all in it for the same thing.

John looks up from his load, his eyes serious.

JOHN:
(thoughtfully) But what is it all for, really? The hunt, the glory, the pride? What's the point of it all?

Abe puts a hand on John's shoulder, his voice gruff.

ABE:
(resolutely) The point, John, is to leave behind a legacy. To know we've made a difference. At least, that's what it is for me.

The group falls silent, lost in their own thoughts. 

As they exit the store, they see that Colonel White and his group have disappeared. They know that they need to get moving if they want to catch up to the buffalo herd. 

Abe looks around at the group, his expression determined.

ABE:
(resolutely) Alright, everyone. Let's get moving. We've got a herd to catch.

The hunters nod in agreement, and the group sets out of town, ready to face whatever challenges the wild frontier has in store for them.
ACT 1 SCENE 10
  

SCENE 10: DEPARTURE FROM FORT WHITE

The hunters finish loading their supplies onto their horses and start to make their way out of Fort White. They are met by a wall of dust and wind that slams into them as they exit the town.

SARAH:
(coughing) Damn, this wind is brutal.

WILLIAM:
(gruffly) That's just the beginning. We're entering some rough territory from here on out.

John looks around at the group, his eyes narrowed with determination.

JOHN:
(resolutely) We can handle it. We've faced worse before.

ABE:
(nodding) That's right. We're not scared of a little challenge.

The group rides on in silence for some time, the only sound the clinking of their equipment and the thud of their horses' hooves. The wind continues to whip around them, picking up dirt and debris and throwing it at the hunters.

BEN:
(shouting) How long do we have to ride like this? My throat's dry as a bone.

RUTH:
(pacing herself) For as long as it takes. We need to find the buffalo herd before they move on.

John looks over at Abe, his expression one of concern.

JOHN:
(worriedly) Abe, are you doing alright? You've been awfully quiet.

Abe doesn't respond for a moment, lost in his own thoughts.

ABE:
(thoughtfully) Just thinking, John. About all the years I've spent out here, chasing after the buffalo. Wondering what it all means.

JOHN:
(curiously) And what does it mean to you?

ABE:
(resolutely) It means everything, John. This land, these animals, they're a part of me. And I'm a part of them. I can't imagine a life without them.

John nods in agreement, understanding the deep connection Abe has to the wild.

JOHN:
(supportively) And you won't have to, Abe. Not as long as I'm around.

The group rides on, the wind continuing to batter them. As they crest a hill, they see the vast expanse of the wild, stretching out before them like an endless sea.

ABE:
(pointing) There it is, John. The buffalo herd. Just beyond that ridge.

JOHN:
(excitedly) Let's go get 'em.

The group picks up speed, their horses galloping towards the distant herd. The wind at their backs, they ride on, ready to face whatever comes their way.
