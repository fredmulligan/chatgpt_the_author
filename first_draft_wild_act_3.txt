ACT 3 SCENE 1

  FADE IN:

EXT. BUFFALO HERD - DAY

Buck's party arrives at the location of the massive buffalo herd they've been tracking. The hunters quickly set up camp and begin preparing for the hunt.

MARY: (examining her rifle) We'll need to be careful. These buffalo are massive and unpredictable. 

RIVAL HUNTER: (smirking) The trick is to take them down quickly. One shot to the head, and they'll go down like a sack of bricks.

TOM: (nervous) I've never hunted anything this big before.

BUCK: (quietly) Don't worry, Tom. We'll help you. 

WILL: (to Buck) Can I talk to you for a minute?

Buck nods, and Will pulls him aside.

WILL: (guarded) Buck, we need to talk.

BUCK: (nodding) Okay.

WILL: (angrily) Why won't you open up? Why won't you talk to me?

BUCK: (sighing) It's not that simple, Will.

WILL: (frustrated) Yes, it is! We're your family, Buck. Why won't you let us in?

FADE IN:

EXT. CAMP - DAY

Buck's party is packing up the buffalo meat and hides when they are approached by the Railroad Baron and his men. The Baron strides toward Buck, his face flushed with anger.

BARON: What in the hell do you think you're doing, Clayton? This land belongs to the railroad now.

BUCK: (calmly) We're just hunting, Baron. Don't see how it concerns you.

BARON: (laughing sarcastically) Oh, I think it does. You and your band of thieves are interfering with my company's plans. Hand over the buffalo meat and hides, and I might let you live.

Buck squares his shoulders, his eyes steady.

BUCK: I'm afraid that's not going to happen, Baron.

The Baron nods to his men, and they draw their guns.

BARON: You're making a mistake, Clayton.

Buck's party also draws their guns, the tension in the air palpable.

BUCK: No, Baron. You're making the mistake. You should leave before you regret it.

The Baron hesitates, his eyes darting between Buck and his men.

BARON: (to his men) Let's go.

As the Baron and his men turn to leave, one of them suddenly takes a shot at Buck. The others follow suit, and chaos erupts.

Buck's party returns fire, but not before several of them are hit. Buck himself is grazed in the arm, but manages to take down several of the Baron's men.

As the dust settles, Buck kneels beside Tom, who is bleeding from a wound in his side.

BUCK: (urgently) Someone get help. Now.

The rest of Buck's party stare at him, their faces grim.

BUCK: (quietly) We'll bury our dead and move on. We can't stay here.

They all nod in agreement, their eyes reflecting the weight of what just happened.

FADE IN:

EXT. AMERICAN WEST - DAY

Buck and his party ride their horses across the vast wilderness, silently reflecting on the events that have unfolded.

Wakan, the Native Chief, appears on the horizon, riding towards them.

WAKAN: (in his native language, subtitled) Buck Clayton. I have heard of your decision to protect the buffalo. It is a wise one.

Buck nods in gratitude.

BUCK: Thank you, Wakan.

WAKAN: (subtitled) The struggle between man and nature has been a long one. But for the sake of our land and our people, we must find a way to coexist.

Buck smiles, understanding the depth of the Chief's words.

BUCK: I couldn't agree more.

Will approaches, a newfound respect and understanding evident in his eyes.

WILL: Dad...I'm proud of you.

Buck looks at Will, a hint of tears in his eyes.

BUCK: (voice choked) I'm proud of you too, son.

There is a mutual respect and admiration between them, unspoken words finally understood.

The party continues on, the wide expanse of the American West stretching out before them.

FADE OUT.
