ACT 1 SCENE 1

  FADE IN:

Buck is in his cabin, cleaning his rifles with great care. He pauses, lost in thought, before resuming his work. Suddenly there is a knock on the door.

Buck hesitates before rising to answer it. When he does, he sees Will standing outside, looking rough around the edges.

Buck: (guarded) What do you want?

Will: I heard you're going on one last hunt.

Buck: (skeptical) And why would you care about that?

Will: (awkwardly) I thought...maybe I could come with you.

Buck stares at Will, taking in his son's appearance, before finally sighing and stepping aside.

Buck: (softly) Come on in.

Will enters hesitantly, looking around the cabin.

Will: (awkwardly) Still living like this, huh?

Buck: (defensively) What's wrong with the way I live?

Will: (shrugs) Just not what I'm used to.

Buck: (sighs) Yeah, well, maybe you should have stayed in the city.

There's an uncomfortable silence as the two men stand facing each other.

Will: (quietly) I know I haven't been around much, but...

Buck: (interrupting) You don't have to explain yourself to me.

Will: (pleading) I just want to make things right.

Buck studies Will for a moment before finally nodding.

Buck: Alright then, you can come with me. But don't expect any special treatment.

Will: (grinning) Wouldn't dream of it.

The two men stare at each other, both feeling the weight of their complicated past.

INT. SALOON - DAY

Buck sits at a table, his maps and hunting gear spread out before him. Will enters the saloon and joins him at the table.

Will: (curious) Who are these guys?

Buck: (gruffly) The people who will be going on this hunt with us.

Will: (impressed) You really know how to pick 'em.

Buck: (smirks) They're the best. (gesturing to the group) This is Mary. She's the tracker. And that's Tom. He's our sharpshooter.

Mary nods at Buck and Will, while Tom looks up eagerly, eager to prove himself.

Buck begins to go through the maps and plans, assigning roles and responsibilities to each member of the group.

Buck: (pointing to different locations on the map) Our best chance to catch the herd will be through this valley. Now, Mary will be leading us through the toughest terrain, so you all better keep up. Tom, you'll be our sharpshooter. I'll be leading the charge to take down the buffalo.

Tom: (impressed) Sounds like my kind of hunt.

Buck: (sternly) This is not a game, Tom. You'd do well to remember that.

Will: (curious) So, how long will this whole thing take?

Buck: (shrugs) Depends on how long it takes to catch the herd. Could be a few days, or it could be a week.

Will: (serious) And what if we don't catch them?

Buck: (grimly) We will.

There's a tension in the air as the group prepares to embark on their journey. Mary checks her equipment, while Tom anxiously tracks the buffalo's movements in the distance. Buck looks at his son, unsure of what to say.

Buck: (hesitantly) Look...I'm doing this for myself. Not for you.

Will: (nodding) I know that.

Buck: (gruffly) Good.

The group sets off the next day, determined to catch the herd and make Buck's final hunt a success.

EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY

Buck's hunting party navigates through the rugged terrain, crossing rivers and climbing steep mountains. They're tired and hungry, and the journey is taking a toll on their spirits.

Mary: (panting) We should stop here for the night.

Buck: (nodding) Agreed.

The group sets up camp near a small stream, building a fire and settling in for the night. As they eat a meager meal of dried meat and hardtack, they hear the distant sound of drums and chanting.

Tom: (nervously) What's that?

Mary: (quietly) A native tribe.

Buck: (cautiously) Everyone stay alert.

The group watches as a group of native men approach them, their faces painted with war paint and their eyes intense.

Native Man: (in Lakota) Who are you? Why do you come into our lands?

Buck: (in Lakota) We're just passing through.

The native man regards Buck warily, sizing him up.

Native Man: (in Lakota) You hunt buffalo?

Buck: (in Lakota) Only when necessary.

Native Man: (skeptically) And when is that?

Buck: (stoically) When we need to feed our families.

The native man seems to be considering this when a woman approaches from behind him.

Woman: (in Lakota) We don't have much to offer, but you're welcome to share our fire.

Buck nods in gratitude, and the hunting party joins the native tribe around their fire. They share stories and food, and Buck begins to see the people of this land in a new light. He realizes that they, too, are fighting to survive in a changing world.

As they settle in for the night, Buck looks up at the stars, lost in thought.

Buck: (to himself) I didn't realize how much I'd missed this.

Mary: (curious) Missed what?

Buck: (smiling) The stars, the wilderness. Feeling like you're a part of something bigger than yourself.

Tom: (in awe) This is amazing.

Buck: (nodding) Sure is.

The hunting party sleeps peacefully, wrapped in their blankets under the starry night sky, aware that their journey ahead will be challenging but filled with new experiences and revelations.

  FADE IN:

EXT. PLAINS - DAY

Buck and his party ride on horseback, following the tracks of the buffalo herd. As they crest a hill, they come face to face with a rival hunting party led by a wiry, reckless hunter named Henry.

Henry: (in a gruff voice) Well, well, well. What do we have here?

Buck: (stoically) Just passing through.

Henry: (smirking) Don't tell me you're looking for that herd of buffalo?

Buck: (firmly) We are.

Henry: (chuckles) Good luck with that. My boys and I have been tracking that herd for weeks.

Mary: (cutting in) We don't want any trouble.

Henry: (tauntingly) I bet you don't. But trouble seems to follow your kind around these parts.

Buck: (drawing his rifle) Leave the buffalo alone, Henry. We won't hesitate to defend them.

Henry: (laughing) You're gonna defend a bunch of cows? That's rich.

Buck and Henry lock eyes, tense and ready for a fight. The tension is broken by the sound of a buffalo bellowing in the distance.

Buck: (grimly) They're getting closer.

Henry: (smirking) Looks like we'll just have to settle this the old-fashioned way.

The two parties circle each other warily, rifles at the ready. Buck and his party are outnumbered, but they stand their ground, determined to protect the buffalo herd.

As the buffalo come into view, the two parties open fire, the sound of gunshots echoing across the plain. The buffalo scatter, their massive bodies thundering past Buck and his party.

In the chaos, Buck and Henry make eye contact again, each sizing up the other.

Buck: (quietly) You don't have to do this, Henry.

Henry: (smiling coldly) I think I do.

The two men raise their rifles, aiming at each other. The moment stretches out, the wind whipping through the grass.

Just as Buck and Henry are about to fire, a massive buffalo charges between them, knocking them both off their feet. The two men scramble to their feet, panting and stunned.

As the rival hunting party rides off in defeat, Buck and his party watch the buffalo herd fade into the distance.

Mary: (quietly) That was close.

Buck: (nodding) We have to protect them. They're worth more than the meat on their bones.

Tom: (awe-struck) They're amazing creatures.

Buck: (nodding) Yes, they are.

The hunting party watches in silence as the buffalo disappear over a ridge, aware that they've just narrowly avoided a deadly confrontation.

  FADE IN:

EXT. PLAINS - DAY

Buck, Mary, and Tom ride through the plains, following the tracks of the buffalo herd. In the distance, they see a group of men on horseback approaching.

As they get closer, Buck sees that the leader is a wealthy businessman, dressed in a fine suit and carrying a rifle.

Railroad Baron: (smiling) My, my. What a motley crew we have here.

Buck: (steely) We're just passing through.

Railroad Baron: (chuckles) I see. And what brings you out here in the middle of nowhere?

Buck: (coolly) Hunting.

Railroad Baron: (disgusted) Hunting? What a pointless waste of time. Don't you know that progress is the only thing that matters these days?

Mary: (cutting in) Progress at what cost?

Railroad Baron: (smirking) At any cost necessary, my dear.

Buck: (firmly) The buffalo are not yours to destroy.

Railroad Baron: (laughing) Destroy? I prefer the term 'utilize'. The land and its resources are there for the taking, and I plan to take as much as I can.

Tom: (angrily) You can't just take whatever you want!

Railroad Baron: (growing impatient) Oh, can't I? You're in way over your head, boy.

Buck: (pointing his rifle) Leave. Now.

The railroad baron's men draw their own weapons, and a tense standoff ensues.

Just then, the sound of the buffalo herd grows louder, and the massive animals come into view.

Buck: (shouting) Get out of here! Now!

The railroad baron's men hesitate, eyeing the herd warily.

Railroad Baron: (grudgingly) Fine. We'll back off for now.

The railroad baron and his men ride off, leaving Buck, Mary, and Tom to gaze in awe at the majestic buffalo herd.

Mary: (whispering) They're beautiful.

Buck: (quietly) Yes, they are.

Tom: (reflectively) Do you think we can really make a difference?

Buck: (nodding) We have to try.

The hunting party watches in silence as the buffalo disappear over the horizon, aware that their fight to protect the West is far from over.

FADE IN:

EXT. PLAINS - DAY

Buck, Mary, and Tom ride slowly towards the massive buffalo herd, their horses huffing and puffing in the unrelenting heat. The sight of the herd leaves them awestruck.

Mary: (whispering) They're beautiful.

Buck: (quietly) Yes, they are.

As they approach the buffalo, they hear the low rumbling of their grunts and snorts, and the thud of their heavy hooves on the earth. Mary looks at Buck, her eyes filled with concern.

Mary: (softly) Are we really going to hunt them?

Buck's eyes grow somber at her question. After a long pause, he responds.

Buck: (painfully) I don't know.

Tom: (eagerly) But we've come all this way, we can't just turn back now!

Buck: (sharply) It's not that simple, Tom.

Tom: (defeated) Then what do we do?

Buck takes a deep breath, looks at the herd one last time, and makes his decision.

Buck: (firmly) We're not going to hunt them.

Mary and Tom look at him in amazement.

Mary: (surprised) But why?

Buck: (earnestly) Because I've spent my life chasing an idea, a myth of what the West should be. But these buffalo, they're alive and breathing. They're what the West actually is. And I won't be part of their destruction.

Tom's face falls, but Mary nods in agreement.

Mary: (nodding) You're right. We can't just kill them for sport.

Buck: (smiling) Come on, let's get out of here.

Buck, Mary and Tom turn around and start to ride away, the thundering sound of the buffalo herd still echoing in their ears.

As they ride away, Buck looks back at the herd, his heart heavy with sadness and regret.

Buck: (thoughtfully) There's more to life than just the hunt.

Mary and Tom nod, silently agreeing with Buck's realization.

FADE OUT.
