End of the Wild
ACT 4 SCENE 1
  Scene 1:

The hunters set up camp in a clearing, their tents and gear scattered around them. They are exhausted but exhilarated, having just completed a long and grueling hunt for a massive buffalo herd. They gather around a campfire, toasting to their shared success with whiskey and hardtack.

ABE:
(raising his glass) To a good hunt.

JOHN:
(cheers) To good company.

SARAH:
(smiling) To a job well done.

BEN:
(laughing) To a feast fit for a king!

The hunters laugh and smile, enjoying each other's company.

WILLIAM:
(quietly) I have something to say.

The hunters look at him, their faces showing concern.

ABE:
(nodding) Go ahead.

William takes a deep breath, his face showing anguish.

WILLIAM:
(voice shaking) I can't do this anymore. I'm tired of the killing. I'm tired of pretending that it's all just for sport. I'm tired of being a part of something that's not right.

There is a moment of silence, as the hunters digest William's words.

ABE:
(gently) You're not alone, William. We've all had our doubts. But we

Scene 2:

The hunters wake up early the next day, full of energy and excitement. They set out on horseback, following the tracks of the remaining buffalo from the herd.

JOHN:
(pointing at the tracks) Looks like they're headed north.

BEN:
(grinning) Let's go get 'em, boys.

As they ride through the rolling hills, they suddenly encounter a group of hunters coming from the opposite direction. At the head of the group is Colonel White, a tall, imposing figure with a fierce glint in his eye.

COLONEL WHITE:
(sarcastically) Well, well, well. If it isn't Abe and his band of merry men.

ABE:
(coolly) What brings you out here, Colonel?

COLONEL WHITE:
(smiling) Oh, just a little friendly competition. I heard you boys had taken down quite a few buffalo from that herd yesterday. I thought I'd come and see if I could show you how it's done.

BEN:
(laughing) You think you can out-hunt us, old man?

COLONEL WHITE:
(grinning) I don't think, son. I know.

ABE:
(considering) What's the wager?

COLONEL WHITE:
(cockily) Winner takes all. You bring down more buffalo than my group does, and we'll give you all the whiskey, supplies, and ammunition we've got. We bring down more, and you hand over your winnings.

The hunters look at each other, weighing the risks and rewards of the challenge.

JOHN:
(nodding) We accept.

The colonel grins, clearly pleased with himself. The two groups split off in opposite directions, riding hard towards the buffalo herds as the race to take them down begins.

The intensity of the hunt is palpable as the hunters race each other to take down the most buffalo. The thrill of competition fuels them, each determined to outdo the other.

SARAH:
(laughing) You boys better watch out. I'm gonna beat you all!

JAMES:
(smirking) Dream on, sister.

BEN:
(excitedly) Look there, John! Over there!

John spots a massive buffalo in the distance, and he takes off after it, his horse galloping at full speed. The other hunters notice his success and follow suit, each pursuing the biggest and strongest buffalo they can find.

The chase is frenzied and wild, as the hunters and the buffalo race through the rugged terrain, dodging obstacles and obstacles. Shots ring out, as the hunters take aim and fire their guns, trying to bring the massive beasts down.

As the sun slowly sinks below the horizon, the hunters finally slow down, their horses foaming and panting. They look around, surveying the aftermath of the hunt.

ABE:
(panting) Well, that was quite a ride.

SARAH:
(whistling) You boys did good.

JOHN:
(smiling) I think we might have won that wager.

The hunters laugh and smile, congratulating each other on their success. However, beneath the surface, each of them is grappling with the emotions of the hunt, the thrill of victory tempered by the harsh reality of their actions.
ACT 4 SCENE 3
  Scene 3:

The hunters ride through a valley, their horses exhausted from the long chase. Suddenly, they hear the sound of drums and chanting in the distance. As they approach, they see a group of Native Americans gathered in a circle, performing a traditional dance.

ABE:
(whispering) We need to be careful.

JOHN:
(nodding) Right.

The hunters slow down, unsure of what to do. Suddenly, a figure steps out from the crowd, wielding a spear.

CHIEF RED HAWK:
(angrily) You have no right to be here. This is our land.

ABE:
(calmly) We mean no harm, Chief Red Hawk. We're just passing through, on our way to a nearby settlement.

CHIEF RED HAWK:
(skeptically) And the guns? And the buffalo carcasses?

BEN:
(defiantly) We're just hunting like we always do. It's nothing personal.

CHIEF RED HAWK:
(furiously) Nothing personal? You are slaughtering our buffalo, destroying our way of life. How can you not see that?

ABE:
(trying to defuse the situation) We didn't mean to cause any offense, Chief. We'll leave if you want us to.

CHIEF RED HAWK:
(shaking his head) It's too late for that. You hunters have been killing our buffalo for years, and we've had enough.

As the tension mounts, John and Sarah step forward, trying to calm the situation.

JOHN:
(pleading) Please, Chief Red Hawk. We don't want any trouble. We just want to pass through.

SARAH:
(reasonably) We understand that we've caused you pain and suffering, and we're truly sorry. We'll leave and never come back if that's what you truly want.

CHIEF RED HAWK:
(contemplating) Very well. You may leave. But remember this: the buffalo are sacred to us. They are our brothers, and we will not hesitate to protect them.

With that, the Chief turns and walks away, his tribe following him. The hunters watch in silence as they disappear into the distance.

ABE:
(shaking his head) That was close.

JAMES:
(angrily) Who do they think they are, telling us we can't hunt?

RUTH:
(calmly) They have a point, James. We've been killing their buffalo for years, and we've never stopped to consider the consequences.

GABRIEL:
(worriedly) We need to be careful. We don't want to start a war.

The hunters nod in agreement, aware that they've narrowly avoided disaster. As they ride away, they realize that their actions have consequences, and they must be more mindful of the impact they have on the land and the people who inhabit it.
ACT 4 SCENE 4
  

Scene 4:

The hunters finally catch up to the remaining buffalo from the herd, and the chase is on. The thrill of the hunt is palpable as they weave through the rugged terrain, dodging obstacles and racing after the massive creatures. The intensity of the hunt becomes a frenzied stampede as the hunters and the buffalo become caught up in their pursuit.

BEN:
(to himself) Come on, you beasts. Show us what you've got.

JAMES:
(voice raised) Don't be so cocky, Ben. These things can kill us as easily as we can kill them.

ABE:
(calmly) Steady now, everyone. We don't want to get caught up in this.

JOHN:
(nodding) Right. Let's focus on the hunt.

SARAH:
(urgently) Watch out for that rock!

The hunters maneuver around the obstacles, their horses panting with exertion. The buffalo loom ahead of them, their massive frames blocking out the sun. The hunters take aim, firing shot after shot at the beasts, determined to bring them down.

RUTH:
(excitedly) Got one!

GABRIEL:
(panting) I think I hit one too.

The chase continues, the hunters and the buffalo locked in a deadly pursuit. The air is thick with dust and the sound of hoofbeats, as the hunters and their prey race across the plain.

BEN:
(laughing) This is what it's all about!

JAMES:
(grimly) This is nothing to joke about, Ben. This is life and death.

ABE:
(calmly) He's right. Don't get ahead of yourself.

The hunters continue to chase the buffalo, taking them down one by one. The ground is littered with the bodies of dead animals, and the hunters are covered in blood and sweat.

JOHN:
(breathless) I...I think that's the last one.

SARAH:
(nodding) Yeah. We did it.

The hunters pause for a moment, catching their breath and surveying the devastation they have wrought.

ABE:
(quietly) Look around you, everyone. This is what we've done.

BEN:
(defensively) What do you mean, Abe?

ABE:
(sadly) We've killed these animals for sport, for pride, for money. And for what? So we can feel powerful, so we can prove something to ourselves?

JAMES:
(angrily) We did what we had to do to survive.

ABE:
(shaking his head) No. We did what we wanted to do. We took something that didn't belong to us, and we destroyed it. And for what? So we could be known as great hunters? So we could get our names in the paper?

RUTH:
(quietly) He's right. We need to think about what we're doing here.

GABRIEL:
(sadly) I don't know if I can keep doing this. It doesn't feel right anymore.

The hunters exchange glances, realizing that the thrill of the hunt has come at a heavy price. They mount their horses and start to ride back to civilization, each lost in their own thoughts.

ABE:
(voiceover) We've taken something that can never be replaced. We've taken a piece of the wild, a piece of ourselves. And we'll never be the same again.

The screen fades to black, and the sound of horses hooves fades into the distance. The hunt is over, but the legacy of what they've done will stay with them forever.
ACT 4 SCENE 5
  

SCENE 5:

The hunters gaze out at the gruesome aftermath of their hunt, surrounded by the carcasses of the buffalo theyâ€™ve slain. The silence is palpable, with each hunter lost in their own thoughts.

ABE:
(sadly) Look at this. This is the price we pay.

JAMES:
(regretfully) It shouldn't have to be like this.

SARAH:
(sighing) It's over. There's nothing we can do now.

JOHN:
(ashamed) I don't know if I can go back to civilization, back to my old life, knowing what we've done here.

The hunters share a heavy sigh, the weight of their actions hanging heavy on them.

BEN:
(defensively) We did what we came for. We were successful.

ABE:
(calmly) And at what cost, Ben? Look around you. Is this what success looks like to you?

RUTH:
(quietly) We've taken so much from this land, from these animals.

GABRIEL:
(emotionally) I don't know how I'll ever be able to justify this to myself or to anyone else.

The hunters continue to stare out into the sea of dead buffalo, each consumed by their own thoughts of regret and guilt.

ABE:
(sighing) We have to go back to civilization, to our families and our loved ones, and live with what we've done here.

The hunters solemnly nod in agreement. The hunt is over, and the damage has been done. There's no going back or undoing what they've done.

ABE:
(voiceover) We took what we wanted without any regard for the consequences. I let my own pride and my own desire to leave a legacy blind me to the damage we've caused.

The sound of horses hooves can be heard as the hunters ride away from the carnage they've created, each carrying with them the weight of their actions.

FADE TO BLACK.

A quote from William Faulkner appears on the screen, as the sound of the hunters' horses fade into the distance:

"The past is never dead. It's not even past."
